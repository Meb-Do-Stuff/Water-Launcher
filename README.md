<h1>Updates:</h1>

1.0.1
------

### ---FEATURES---
* New name & logo!
* UI rework
* Now, you'll know when there is a new update!

### ---FIXES---
* exit() was not recognised by py-to-exe, and that causes huge problems (so I just change it by sys.exit())
* The button for going to @Moojuiceman-LSMods repo wasn't working (just a mistake in the keys)
* When you remove a mod, it was always showed as install on the list (because it wasn't update)

Also, sorry for spelling and grammar mistakes, my English is kinda bad, have fun ^^

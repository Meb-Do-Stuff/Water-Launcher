<h1> Water Launcher! </h1>

This is a simple software for managing Landlord's Super mods <a href="https://github.com/Moojuiceman-LSMods">Moojuiceman's mods</a>, so this is <b>NOT</b> my mods.
<br>
This is a portable software.
In case of any problems, please go to <a href="https://discord.gg/A253AkJ2qv">Minskworks Discord</a> to report it.

<h2> Installation </h2>
Click on the latest release <a href="https://github.com/MeblIkea/Landlords-Super-Mod-Manager/releases">(or here)</a>
<br>
Then click on <a href="https://github.com/MeblIkea/Water-Launcher/releases/latest/download/Water-Launcher.exe">Water.Launcher.exe</a> for downloading it

Now, you can launch it.<br>
/!\ Windows can detect the new version as a virus (I can't do nothing about it :'( )

<h2> Setup </h2>
When you see the setup window, you have to put your Landlord's Super directory (press "Default" if it is always in default Steam location)
<br>
<i>If it say "This directory exist, and is Landlord's Super", then you can click "Set". Else, you have to get the good Landlord's Super location.</i>

<h2> Customisation </h2>
If you want to change the theme, you can click "Themes" > "Set themes".
<br>
Click "List themes" for see every theme you can have, then keep the name of your theme in mind. 
<br>
Close the list themes window, and put the name of your theme in the input.
<br>
Click "set themes", close and re-open the software, and it's good.

<h2> Installing the main mod </h2>
<i> For every mods can work, you have to install a <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx"> main mod </a> (it's automatically installed).</i>
  
  (more information under 
  [Moojuiceman's repo](https://github.com/Moojuiceman-LSMods))</i>
</br>
You just have to click "Install" on the main tab, and you are good to go.

<h2> Installing a mod </h2>
